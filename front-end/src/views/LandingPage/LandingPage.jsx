                          20th century,
                          largely due to the massive ivory trade. While some populations are now stable and growing, poaching,
                          conflict and habitat destruction continue to threaten the species.</p>

                                      learning.
                                      This is not a trivial task even for a human since elephants naturally blend in with their

                                      making it a challenging and meaningful problem to solve. Possible applications of this work

                                      images we can upload photos to the system and detect whether there are elephants in those
                                      photos and get a count of them.To achieve this goal we need to have quality number of photos
                                      and a trained model which can identify elephants. We run the images through filters and
                                      clarify the identification.When we train more images using the model the accuracy rate
                                      increase.</p>
